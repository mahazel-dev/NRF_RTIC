# NRF_RTIC

Hello everyone,

It is my project of self-learning Rust on Embedded Devices. I work on NRF52840DK (Cortec M4 with NFC and BLE).
What I want to achieve:
  - UART communication PC-uC with interrupt trigger - almost DONE
  - usage of OLED via I2C - display SSD1306 oredred;
  - usage of fingerprint sensor via SPI - BM-Lite ordered;
  - NFC communication - have to make plan;
  - and more by the time..


I use RTIC as main event handler, because it sound interesting for me.
By the time code is growing and getting mroe complicated, but I try to keep it.
I'm not professional, but I'd like to become. If you have suggestions, please don;t hesitate to tell me. Or if you can offer help with learning 
by giving assigments or intern I'm open for every opportunity.


Besr regards and welcome to Rust and RTIC
